# TactileAugmentation

AR project, combining Leap motion with Oculus rift and arduino construction 
to augment tactile feedback in Unity VR application.
With the help of leap motion, hands of the user are tracked in real time. A self designed and constructed 
finger-vibrating glove translates touch interaction in VR to vibrations at each involved finger.

Compartements of project:

- Arduino microcontroller for finger-vibrating gloves

- Unity VR application implementing Leap motion framework allowing hands to be tracked in real time.
